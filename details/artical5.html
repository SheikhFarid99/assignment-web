                    <p>It can’t be emphasized enough: engaging in physical activity is the single most important thing
                        you can do to maintain mobility and independence, no matter your age or your health status. It
                        can help you control your weight. It’s the key to keeping your muscles and bones strong, your
                        joints working properly, your heart healthy, and your metabolism revved. The more you move, the
                        better your strength and balance will be, and the less likely you will be to fall or lose the
                        ability to perform basic daily functions. And that’s on top of all the other health benefits of
                        regular exercise, such as reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some
                        cancers. Exercise even has positive effects on mood and may help improve cognitive function.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In addition to doing targeted exercises for muscle strength and flexibility, joint health, and
                        balance, you should strive to increase routine daily physical activities that aren’t formal
                        exercise, such as climbing stairs. If you’re in pain, all this activity may seem impossible. But
                        in many cases, exercise actually helps reduce the pain. If you have osteoarthritis, for example,
                        regular exercise not only helps maintain joint function, but also helps relieve stiffness and
                        diminishes pain and fatigue. Maintaining muscle strength can also help dampen stresses on
                        joints.</p>
                    <p>How much exercise do you need? For healthy adults, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
                        from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend 150 to 300 minutes of moderate
                        exercise a week, with activity every day. The guidelines also recommend twice-weekly strength
                        training sessions and balance exercises for older adults at risk of falling. Disability should
                        not be a reason to refrain from all activity. The guidelines state: "When older adults cannot do
                        150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they
                        should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow." Even modest efforts
                        count. "Move more and sit less throughout the day," the guidelines advise. "Some activity is
                        better than none."</p>
